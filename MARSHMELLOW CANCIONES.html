I'm so alone<br>
Nothing feels like home<br>
I'm so alone<br>
Trying to find my way back home to you<br>
I'm so alone<br>
Nothing feels like home<br>
I'm so alone<br>
Trying to find my way back home to you<br><br>

You-you-you-you, you-you-you-you<br>
You-you-you-you, you-you-you-you<br>
I'm so alone<br>
Trying to find my way back home to you<br><br>

	Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br><br>

When the morning comes<br>
When we see what we've become<br>
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind<br>
Not the fire that we've begun<br>
Every argument, every word we can't take back<br>
'Cause with the all that has happened<br>
I think that we both know the way that this story ends<br><br>

Then only for a minute<br>
I want to change my mind<br>
'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
I wanna raise your spirits<br>
I want to see you smile but<br>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br><br>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>

When the evening falls<br>
And I'm left there with my thoughts<br>
And the image of you being with someone else<br>
Well, that's eating me up inside<br>
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay<br>
Now if we jump together at least we can swim<br>
Far away from the wreck we made<br><br>

Then only for a minute<br>
I want to change my mind<br>
'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
I wanna raise your spirits<br>
I want to see you smile but<br>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>

So I'll go, I'll go<br>
I will go, go, go<br>
So I'll go, I'll go<br>
I will go, go, go<br>

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>
Even though I might not like this<br>
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier<br><br>

Then only for a minute (only for a minute)<br>
I want to change my mind<br>
'Cause this just don't feel right to me<br>
I wanna raise your spirits<br>
I want to see you smile but<br>
Know that means I'll have to leave<br><br>

Know that means I'll have to leave<br>
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking<br>
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier<br>
So I'll go, I'll go<br>
I will go, go, go<br><br>
