Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder<br>

I was caught<br>
In the middle of a railroad track (thunder)<br>
I looked 'round<br>
And I knew there was no turning back (thunder)<br>
My mind raced<br>
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)<br>
And I knew<br><br>
There was no help, no help from you (thunder)<br>
Sound of the drums<br>
Beating in my heart<br>
The thunder of guns<br>
Tore me apart<br>
You've been<br>
Thunderstruck<br><br>

Rode down the highway<br>
Broke the limit, we hit the town<br>
Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas, and we had some fun<br>
We met some girls<br>
Some dancers who gave a good time<br>
Broke all the rules<br>
Played all the fools<br>
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds<br>
And I was shaking at the knees<br>
Could I come again, please?<br>
Yeah, them ladies were too kind<br>
You've been<br>
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck<br>
Ooh, thunderstruck, yeah<br><br>

I was shaking at the knees<br>
Could I come again, please? Oh<br><br>

<h1><font color="blueviolet" size="7" face="berlin sans fb"><center>BACK IN BLACK</center></font></h1>
<p>
Back in black<br>
I hit the sack<br>
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back<br>
Yes, I'm let loose<br>
From the noose<br>
That's kept me hanging about<br>
I've been looking at the sky<br>
'Cause it's gettin' me high<br>
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die<br>
I got nine lives<br>
Cat's eyes<br>
Abusin' every one of them and running wild<br><br>

'Cause I'm back<br>
Yes, I'm back<br>
Well, I'm back<br>
Yes, I'm back<br>
Well, I'm back, back<br>
Well, I'm back in black<br>
Yes, I'm back in black<br><br>

Back in the back<br>
Of a Cadillac<br>
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack<br>
Yes, I'm in a bang<br>
With a gang<br>
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang<br>
'Cause I'm back on the track<br>
And I'm beatin' the flack<br>
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap<br>
So look at me now<br>
I'm just makin' my play<br>
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way<br><br>

'Cause I'm back<br>
Yes, I'm back<br>
Well, I'm back<br>
Yes, I'm back<br>
Well, I'm back, back<br>
Well, I'm back in black<br>
Yes, I'm back in black<br><br>

Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back<br>
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back<br>
