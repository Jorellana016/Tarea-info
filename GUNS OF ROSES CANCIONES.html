She's got a smile that it seems to me<br>
Reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky<br>
Now and then when I see her face<br>
She takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry<br><br>

Whoa, oh, oh<br>
Sweet child o' mine<br>
Whoa, oh, oh, oh<br>
Sweet love of mine<br><br>

She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br>
As if they thought of rain<br>
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place<br>
Where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by<br><br>

Whoa, oh, oh<br>
Sweet child o' mine<br>
Whoa whoa, oh, oh, oh<br>
Sweet love of mine<br><br>

Whoa, yeah<br>
Whoa, oh, oh, oh<br>
Sweet child o' mine<br>
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh<br>
Sweet love of mine<br>
Whoa, oh, oh, oh<br><br>

<p>	
	When I look into your eyes<br>
I can see a love restrained<br>
But darlin' when I hold you<br>
Don't you know I feel the same?<br><br>

Nothin' lasts forever<br>
And we both know hearts can change<br>
And it's hard to hold a candle<br>
In the cold November rain<br><br>

We've been through this such a long long time<br>
Just tryin' to kill the pain, ooh yeah<br>
Love is always coming, love is always going<br>
No one's really sure who's lettin' go today<br>
Walking away<br><br>

If we could take the time to lay it on the line<br>
I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine<br>
All mine<br>
So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain<br>
Or I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain<br><br>

Do you need some time on your own?<br>
Do you need some time all alone?<br>
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own<br>
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone<br><br>

I know it's hard to keep an open heart<br>
When even friends seem out to harm you<br>
But if you could heal a broken heart<br>
Wouldn't time be out to charm you?<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
</p>

<p>	

Talk to me softly<br>
There's something in your eyes<br>
Don't hang your head in sorrow<br>
And please don't cry<br>
I know how you feel inside I've<br>
I've been there before<br>
Somethin's changin' inside you<br>
And don't you know<br><br>

Don't you cry tonight<br>
I still love you, baby<br>
Don't you cry tonight<br>
Don't you cry tonight<br>
There's a heaven above you, baby<br>
And don't you cry tonight<br><br>

Give me a whisper<br>
And give me a sigh<br>
Give me a kiss before you<br>
Tell me goodbye<br>
Don't you take it so hard now <br>
And please don't take it so bad<br>
I'll still be thinkin' of you<br>
And the times we had, baby<br><br>

And don't you cry tonight<br>
Don't you cry tonight<br>
Don't you cry tonight<br>
There's a heaven above you, baby<br>
And don't you cry tonight<br>
