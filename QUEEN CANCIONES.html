<p>
Is this the real life?<br>
Is this just fantasy?<br>
Caught in a landside,<br>
No escape from reality<br>
Open your eyes,<br>
Look up to the skies and see,<br>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br>
Because I'm easy come, easy go,<br>
Little high, little low,<br>
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to<br>
Me, to me<br><br>

Mamaaa,<br>
Just killed a man,<br>
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,<br>
Now he's dead<br>
Mamaaa, life had just begun,<br>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
Mama, oooh,<br>
Didn't mean to make you cry,<br>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,<br>
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters<br><br>

Too late, my time has come,<br>
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all<br>
The time<br>
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,<br>
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br>
Mama, oooh<br>
I don't want to die,<br>
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.<br><br>

I see a little silhouetto of a man,<br>
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!<br><br>

Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me<br>
Galileo, Galileo<br>
Galileo, Galileo<br>
Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo<br><br>

I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me<br>
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,<br>
Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br>
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go<br>
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go<br>
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
(Let me go) Will not let you go<br>
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go<br>
(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah<br>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go<br>
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,<br>
For meee<br><br>

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye<br>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die<br>
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,<br>
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here<br><br>

Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,<br>
Nothing really matters,<br>
Nothing really matters to me<br>
Any way the wind blows...<br>

<h1><font color="blueviolet" size="7" face="berlin sans fb"><center>Love of My Life</center></font></h1>
<p>
Love of my life, you've hurt me<br>
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me<br>
Love of my life, can't you see?<br>
Bring it back, bring it back<br>
Don't take it away from me<br>
Because you don't know<br>
What it means to me<br><br>

Love of my life, don't leave me<br>
You've taken my love, and now desert me<br>
Love of my life, can't you see?<br>
Bring it back, bring it back<br>
Don't take it away from me<br>
Because you don't know<br>
What it means to me<br><br>

You will remember<br>
When this is blown over<br>
And everything's all by the way<br>
When I grow older<br>
I will be there at your side to remind you<br>
How I still love you (I still love you)<br><br>

Back, hurry back<br>
Please, bring it back home to me<br>
Because you don't know<br>
What it means to me<br><br>

Love of my life<br>
Love of my life<br>
Ooh, ooh<br>
