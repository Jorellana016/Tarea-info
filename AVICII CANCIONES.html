<p>Once upon a younger year<br>
When all our shadows disappeared<br>
The animals inside came out to play<br>
Went face to face with all our fears<br>
Learned our lessons through the tears<br>
Made memories we knew would never fade<br><br>

One day, my father, he told me<br>
"Son, don't let it slip away"<br>
He took me in his arms, I heard him say<br>
"When you get older<br>
Your wild heart will live for younger days<br>
Think of me if ever you're afraid"<br><br>

He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind<br>
So live a life you will remember"<br>
My father told me when I was just a child<br>
"These are the nights that never die"<br>
My father told me<br><br>

"When thunderclouds start pouring down<br>
Light a fire they can't put out<br>
Carve your name into those shining stars"<br>
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores<br>
Don't forsake this life of yours<br>
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"<br><br>

One day, my father, he told me<br>

When I was just a kid, I heard him say<br>

Think of me if ever you're afraid"<br><br>

Oh oh sometimes, I get a good feeling<br>
Yeah<br>
Get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no<br>
I get a good feeling, yeah<br>
Oh oh sometimes, I get a good feeling<br>

<h1><font color="blueviolet" size="7" face="berlin sans fb"><center>WAKE ME UP</center></font></h1>
<p>
Feeling my way through the darkness<br>
Guided by a beating heart<br>
I can't tell where the journey will end<br>
But I know where to start<br>
They tell me I'm too young to understand<br>
They say I'm caught up in a dream<br>
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes<br>
Well that's fine by me<br><br>

So wake me up when it's all over<br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
All this time I was finding myself, and I<br>
Didn't know I was lost<br><br>

So wake me up when it's all over<br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
All this time I was finding myself, and I<br>
Didn't know I was lost<br><br>

I tried carrying the weight of the world<br>
But I only have two hands<br>
Hope I get the chance to travel the world<br>
But I don't have any plans<br>
Wish that I could stay forever this young<br>
Not afraid to close my eyes<br>
Life's a game made for everyone<br>
And love is a prize<br><br>

So wake me up when it's all over<br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
All this time I was finding myself, and I<br>
Didn't know I was lost<br><br>

So wake me up when it's all over<br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
All this time I was finding myself, and I<br>
I didn't know I was lost<br><br>

I didn't know I was lost<br>
I didn't know I was lost<br>
I didn't know I was lost<br>
I didn't know<br><br>
