Mm-mmm<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>

Yeah<br><br>

My momma called, seen you on TV, son<br>
Said shit done changed ever since we was on<br>
I dreamed it all ever since I was young<br>
They said I wouldn't be nothing<br>
Now they always say congratulations<br>
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation<br>
They ain't never had the dedication<br>
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it<br>
Yeah, we made it<br><br>

They was never friendly, yeah<br>
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah<br>
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah<br>
But I know I had to have it, yeah<br>
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah<br>
I be itching like a addict, yeah<br>
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah<br>
But they didn't know me last year, yeah<br>
Everyone wanna act like they important<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Everyone counting on me, drop the ball<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah, yeah<br>
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky<br>
How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?<br>
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side<br>
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes<br><br>

Young nigga, young nigga, graduation<br>
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby<br>
I'm looking for someone to call, baby<br>
But right now, I got a situation<br>
Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins<br>
Big rings, champagne<br>
My life is like a ball game<br>
But instead, I'm in the trap though<br>
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl<br>
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls<br>
